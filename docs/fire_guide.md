**Complete guide to Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) methodology**

---

## What is FIRE?

FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is a movement focused on achieving financial independence through:
- High savings rates (50%+ of income)
- Smart investing (index funds, diversification)
- Living below your means
- Building passive income streams

**Goal:** Save enough to retire decades before traditional retirement age (65).

## The Core Principles

### 1. The 4% Rule

**Foundation of FIRE:** You need 25x your annual expenses saved.

```
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 25
```

**Why 25?** Based on the Trinity Study:
- Withdraw 4% annually from your portfolio
- Historically safe for 30+ year retirement
- Accounts for market volatility

**Example:**
```python
Annual Expenses: $40,000
FIRE Number: $40,000 × 25 = $1,000,000

Can safely withdraw: $40,000/year (4%)
```

### 2. Savings Rate is King

**Most important factor:** NOT your salary, but % you save.

**Years to FIRE by Savings Rate:**

| Savings Rate | Years to FIRE |
|--------------|---------------|
| 10%          | 51 years      |
| 25%          | 32 years      |
| 50%          | 17 years      |
| 70%          | 9 years       |

**Formula:**
```
Years = log(1 + savings_rate / withdrawal_rate) / log(1 + return_rate)
```

---

### 3. Compound Interest Magic

**Einstein:** "Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world"

**Rule of 72:**
```
Years to double = 72 / annual return rate

8% return → doubles every 9 years
10% return → doubles every 7.2 years
```

**Example:**
```
$10,000 invested at 8% annual return:
Year 0: $10,000
Year 9: $20,000
Year 18: $40,000
Year 27: $80,000
Year 36: $160,000
```
